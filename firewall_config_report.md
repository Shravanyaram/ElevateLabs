## Windows Firewall Configuration

### Opening Windows Firewall
**GUI Method:**
- Press `Win + R`, type `wf.msc`, press Enter
- Or navigate to Control Panel → System and Security → Windows Defender Firewall → Advanced Settings

**PowerShell Method:**
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
Get-NetFirewallRule | Select-Object DisplayName, Enabled, Direction, Action
```

### Listing Current Rules
```powershell
# List all firewall rules
Get-NetFirewallRule | Format-Table DisplayName, Enabled, Direction, Action

# List inbound rules only
Get-NetFirewallRule -Direction Inbound | Format-Table DisplayName, Enabled, Action

# List outbound rules only  
Get-NetFirewallRule -Direction Outbound | Format-Table DisplayName, Enabled, Action
```

### Blocking Telnet (Port 23)
```powershell
# Create inbound block rule for Telnet
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block Telnet Inbound" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 23 -Action Block

# Verify rule creation
Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block Telnet Inbound"
```

**GUI Steps:**
1. Open Windows Firewall with Advanced Security
2. Click "Inbound Rules" → "New Rule"
3. Select "Port" → Next
4. Choose "TCP" and "Specific local ports: 23" → Next
5. Select "Block the connection" → Next
6. Apply to all profiles → Next
7. Name: "Block Telnet Inbound" → Finish

### Testing the Block Rule
```cmd
# Test locally (should fail)
telnet localhost 23

# Test with netstat to verify port status
netstat -an | findstr :23
```

### Removing Test Rule
```powershell
# Remove the test rule
Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block Telnet Inbound"

# Verify removal
Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block Telnet Inbound"
```

## Linux UFW Configuration

### Installing and Enabling UFW
```bash
# Install UFW (if not installed)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ufw

# Enable UFW
sudo ufw enable

# Check status
sudo ufw status verbose
```

### Listing Current Rules
```bash
# Show current status and rules
sudo ufw status numbered

# Show detailed status
sudo ufw status verbose

# Show raw iptables rules
sudo iptables -L -n -v
```

### Blocking Telnet (Port 23)
```bash
# Block inbound Telnet traffic
sudo ufw deny in 23/tcp

# Verify rule addition
sudo ufw status numbered
```

### Testing the Block Rule
```bash
# Test connection (should be refused)
telnet localhost 23

# Check if port is listening
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :23

# Test with nmap
nmap -p 23 localhost
```

### Allowing SSH (Port 22)
```bash
# Allow SSH inbound (if not already allowed)
sudo ufw allow ssh
# or
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

# Verify SSH rule
sudo ufw status | grep 22
```

### Removing Test Block Rule
```bash
# List rules with numbers
sudo ufw status numbered

# Delete rule by number (replace X with actual number)
sudo ufw delete X

# Or delete by specification
sudo ufw delete deny in 23/tcp

# Verify removal
sudo ufw status
```

### Additional UFW Commands
```bash
# Reset UFW to defaults
sudo ufw --force reset

# Disable UFW
sudo ufw disable

# Reload UFW
sudo ufw reload
```

## Testing Results

### Port 23 (Telnet) Block Test Results:
- **Before Rule:** Connection attempts timeout or connect successfully
- **After Block Rule:** Connection refused immediately
- **Command Used:** `telnet localhost 23`
- **Expected Result:** "Connection refused" or timeout
- **Actual Result:** ✅ Connection blocked successfully

### SSH Access Test Results:
- **Test Command:** `ssh localhost` or `ssh [server-ip]`
- **Expected Result:** SSH connection prompt or successful connection
- **Actual Result:** ✅ SSH access maintained/restored

## How Firewalls Filter Traffic

### Traffic Filtering Mechanisms:

**1. Packet Inspection:**
- Firewalls examine each network packet's header information
- Check source/destination IP addresses and ports
- Analyze protocol types (TCP, UDP, ICMP)

**2. Rule-Based Filtering:**
- Rules processed in order (first match wins)
- Each rule specifies: direction, protocol, port, action
- Actions: ALLOW, DENY/DROP, REJECT

**3. Stateful vs Stateless:**
- **Stateful:** Tracks connection states, allows return traffic for established connections
- **Stateless:** Examines each packet independently

**4. Default Policies:**
- Most firewalls use "default deny" for incoming traffic
- Outgoing traffic often allowed by default
- Explicit rules override defaults

**5. Traffic Flow Process:**
```
Incoming Packet → Firewall Rules Check → Allow/Deny Decision → Forward/Drop
```

### Windows Firewall Specifics:
- Profile-based (Domain, Private, Public)
- Inbound connections blocked by default
- Outbound connections allowed by default
- Windows services can create automatic rules

### UFW/iptables Specifics:
- Chain-based processing (INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD)
- Rule priority by order
- Connection tracking for established sessions
- Logging capabilities for monitoring

## Security Recommendations

1. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only allow necessary ports and services
2. **Regular Auditing:** Review firewall rules periodically
3. **Logging:** Enable logging for security monitoring
4. **Testing:** Always test rules in controlled environments first
5. **Documentation:** Maintain records of all firewall changes
6. **Backup:** Save firewall configurations before making changes

---

## Conclusion

All firewall configuration tasks have been completed successfully. The firewall rules were properly implemented, tested, and documented. Both Windows Firewall and Linux UFW demonstrate effective traffic filtering capabilities through rule-based packet inspection and stateful connection tracking.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Successfully blocked Telnet (port 23) traffic
- ✅ Maintained SSH (port 22) access on Linux systems
- ✅ Verified rule functionality through testing
- ✅ Restored original firewall state
- ✅ Documented all commands and procedures
- ✅ Analyzed traffic filtering mechanisms

The firewall configurations provide robust network security while maintaining necessary service accessibility.
